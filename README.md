Samantha Mikaiel's Entry to the Coding Challenge

Thank you for considering me for the Data Engineering position. 
The shell file is run.sh. This will compile the C++ program. 
The source code is under the /src folder
Input has the log.csv and inactivity_period.txt and Output has the sessionization.txt file
The insight_testsuite has the passed test 

I have tested my code with log files on multiple days and different inactivity periods

Thank you again,
Samantha Mikaiel
